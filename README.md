# **cangkIR**

A laboratory project called **cangKir** which is an online shop that sells various types of glassware in terms of shape, size and price. In this case, we were asked to create a desktop application that can help users to buy the desired items and inventory management for the admin.
This application uses JavaFX Programming Language and MySQL for the database.

In this project I am responsible for:
- Configuring Eclipse 2020 with the necessary libraries.
- Creating a series of application layouts using JavaFX GUI
- Building constraint logic and validation for user actions
- Connecting the application with the cangkIR database
- Conducting testing of the application
- Make a final project report to be submitted 

Tools used:
- 🧑‍💻 Eclipse IDE Version 2020
- 📚 jfxtras-labs-9.0 Library
- 📑 JavaFX Library
- 📊 XAMPP
